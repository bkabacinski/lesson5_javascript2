### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. If/else statements perform one action when a condition is true and perform a different action when a condition is false.
2. A loop statement repeatedly executes a statement or a series of statements.
3. A good programming technique is to always use the var keyword when declaring variables because it clarifies when and where the variable is used.
